    <p class="title">Heart</p>
    <p class="description">The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals, which pumps blood through the
      blood vessels of the circulatory system. Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as assists in
      the removal of metabolic wastes. The heart is located in the middle compartment of the chest.</p>

    <p class="title">Blood</p>
    <p class="description">Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as
      nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.</p>

    <p class="title">Blood Vessel</p>
    <p class="description"> The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout
      the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the
      heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues;
      and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word vascular, meaning relating
      to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin vas, meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the
      lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled avascular.
